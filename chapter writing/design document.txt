DESIGN

Strategies:
Divide and conquer
Each component calls the component/tag down below

Techniques:
Recursion

Requirements:
* Only display required children (low)
* Each XML tag is mapped to a component (high)
* Each XML tag knows only about their component (high)
* Communication ... happens ... (low)

Drawback with earlier design:
* Creating the React component tree on the fly triggered a lot of rerenders. 
  Purely working from the XML file does not.
